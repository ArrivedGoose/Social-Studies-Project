        <h1>Fundalmentalism and the Scopes Trial</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Scopes Trial helped in getting rid of Fundamentalism, which was a very bad and problematic way of teaching.</h2> <br>
        <p>The Scopes Trial started in Dayton, Tennessee. It was caused because John Scopes was accused of teaching evolution in school. At the time in Tennessee a law had been passed, the Butler Act, which made it illegal to  teach evolution in schools. This law was pushed, and eventually got passed by a group known as the Fundamentalists. This group has many outdated and problematic beliefs. The main ones are that they are very opposed to abbortion and queer people, adamantly support school paryer, and beleive in traditional roles for women. You might know this group as the religious right.</p>

            <img class="img" src="Scopes.jpeg" width="180" height="234"> <p>The Scopes Trialâ€™s prosecution was headed by William Jennings Bryan, while the defense was headed by Clarence Darrow. The ACLU had also promised to defend anybody who was prosecuted under these laws because they thought that they were unfair, so John Scopes did not have to pay for a defense. As the trial went on its attention grew many times bigger, and they had to move onto the courthouse lawn. This shows that the trial was so big it was reaching a wide audience and making them think about fundamentalism, and its consequences. He was eventually convicted of teaching evolution, and was fined 100$, which he was pardoned from because it was seen as excessive.</p>

        <p>Next, I would like to show why one of the fundamentalists' values is wrong. One of their beliefs is that women should be in traditional roles. This is incorrect because of a number of reasons, most of which they (fundamentalists) would dispute. One thing that I think both of us could agree on is that it is good when the economy does well, and women contribute a lot to that. Women make up about half of the population of the US, or about 166 million people, and according to the bureau of labor statistics, 57.4 percent of all women participated in the labor force, as of 2019. This means that 59.6 percent of the labor force is women. If all of these people were in the traditional roles, or something like that, our economy would suffer terribly.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I want to tell you why fundamentalism is a bad idea in general. If you look at the past, you can observe something interesting happening. As our reliance on religion has dropped, our life expectancy has increased. This might be correlation rather than causation, but, when you think about it, historically, at times when we have been more invested in religion, like the dark ages, we have had really low life expectancy. Even if it is correlation, it cannot mean anything good for religion if it tracks inversely with life expectancy. This one may be a bit of a stretch, but I could not find any sources that actually covered whether this is true.</p>
